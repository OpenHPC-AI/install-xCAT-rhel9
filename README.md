Solution:

> Note: Don’t Install xCAT packages from repo, if installed then removed the xcat packages
> 

```jsx
yum remove xCAT
```
# To Install xcat on rhel9 

**git clone the repo**



```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenHPC-AI/install-xCAT-rhel9.git
cd install-xCAT-rhel9
#The setup_xcat.sh script installs xCAT and resolves the OpenSSL and initscripts issues.
chmod +x setup_xcat.sh
./setup_xcat.sh
```

# Osimage configuration (copycds) for rocky9.6

Get the discinfo of rocky9.6 iso

```bash
# Install or copy rocky9.6 iso in your /tmp dir
# mount the iso in to /tmp/iso/rocky9.6/
mount  /tmp/Rocky-9.6-x86_64-dvd.iso /tmp/iso/rocky9.6/

#get the disinfo
cat /tmp/iso/rocky9.6/.discinfo | head -n 1
# expample discinfo for rocky9.6 dvd iso is: 1748309243.9338255
```

Once you get the discinfo id add in /opt/xcat/lib/perl/xCAT/data/discinfo.pm file

```bash
#For rocky9.6 dvd iso 
bash setup_disc info.sh
```


**[OR]**

# You can manually setup the xcat on el9 

**`Step1: Download the go-xcat tool using wget:`**

```jsx
# Install go-xcat support package to fix the problem
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xcat2/xcat-core/master/xCAT-server/share/xcat/tools/go-xcat -O - >/tmp/go-xcat

(or)
cd /tmp
git clone  https://github.com/OpenHPC-AI/go-xcat-el9.git

# Change the permission to execute
chmod +x /tmp/go-xcat-el9/go-xcat

```

**`Step2: Run the go-xcat tool:`**

```jsx
/tmp/go-xcat -x latest install -y
```

NOTE: 

1. This will fail with the certificate issue but carry on with the below.
2. I had previous suggested running the command with the devel option but it works with the standard install anyway.

**Step3.**

```jsx
# Setup Openssl patch
bash ssl_patch_setup.sh
```

**Step4**.

**Source the profile to add xCAT Commands to your path:**

```jsx
source /etc/profile.d/xcat.sh
```

**Step6**.
**`Reinitialise the xcat installation:`** 

```jsx
xcatconfig -i -c -s
```

**Step7.**
**`Restart the xcatd service and Check the xCAT version:`**  

```jsx
restartxcatd

lsxcatd -a
```

> **Tips:**
> 
> 
> ```
> You need to install the initscripts RPM. el9 dropped sysinit for systemd
> and xCAT is sysinit based.
> You have to do this before trying to install xCAT because it will break your /etc/init.d symlink.
> go-xcat will install initscripts for you.
> ```
